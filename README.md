## Hi !!

I'm Souna, I use Lua and its game framework LÖVE2D.<br/>
꩜ I code as a hobby and I'm currently working on a set of Lua and L2D scripts to help to easily develop Yume Nikki fangames.<br/>
꩜ I love old and retro RPG's such as the Earthbound series and I wish to contribute to the indie community in the future :).<br/>
